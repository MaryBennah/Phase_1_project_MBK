# Project Overview 
This project aims to identify the lowest-risk aircraft types based on historical aviation accident data to support a company's expansion into the aviation sector. By analyzing data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) spanning from 1962 to 2023, I aim to provide actionable recommendations for selecting safe aircraft models for commercial and private use.
## Project Goals:
Clean and preprocess a large aviation dataset
Handle missing or incomplete records with appropriate imputation strategies.
Identify and visualize key risk factors.
# Business Understanding
## Stakeholder :
Head of the new Aviation Division — responsible for aircraft purchasing and fleet safety planning
## Key Business Questions:
Which aircraft types have the lowest number of severe accidents?
Are certain manufacturers or models more prone to incidents than others?
What trends or patterns can inform safer investments in aircraft (e.g., geography, weather, purpose of flight)?
## Business Objective:
Make data-driven decisions on which aircraft to purchase based on safety and historical risk data, minimizing operational and insurance costs.
