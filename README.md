# Project Overview 
This project aims to identify the lowest-risk aircraft types based on historical aviation accident data to support a company's expansion into the aviation sector. By analyzing data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) spanning from 1962 to 2023, I aim to provide actionable recommendations for selecting safe aircraft models for commercial and private use.
## Project Goals:
Clean and preprocess a large aviation dataset
Handle missing or incomplete records with appropriate imputation strategies.
Identify and visualize key risk factors.
# Business Understanding
## Stakeholder :
Head of the new Aviation Division — responsible for aircraft purchasing and fleet safety planning
## Key Business Questions:
Which aircraft types have the lowest number of severe accidents?
Are certain manufacturers or models more prone to incidents than others?
What trends or patterns can inform safer investments in aircraft (e.g., geography, weather, purpose of flight)?
## Business Objective:
Make data-driven decisions on which aircraft to purchase based on safety and historical risk data, minimizing operational and insurance costs.

# Conclusion
## Summary of Findings
### Downward Trend in Incident Frequency Over Time
Since 1990, the annual rate of aviation accidents has steadily declined, particularly in the commercial sector. This trend likely reflects advancements in regulatory standards, aircraft technology, pilot training, and incident reporting practices.
### Low-Risk Aircraft Models Identified 
Specific aircraft models, including the Cessna 172, Piper PA-28, and Beechcraft Bonanza, exhibit the lowest incidence of fatal or severe accidents relative to their prevalence in the dataset. These models demonstrate consistently favorable safety profiles across multiple decades.

# Strategic  Recommendations
## Prioritize Proven Low-Risk Aircraft
Invest in aircraft such as the Cessna 172, Piper PA-28, and Beechcraft Bonanza, which have consistently exhibited low risk based on historical accident severity and frequency. These models are well-established in the general aviation sector and offer reliable safety records.

## Focus on Commercial and Business Operations
Limit fleet acquisition for personal or recreational use, which carries elevated risk. Instead, prioritize aircraft that will operate under regulated commercial or business environments with standardized procedures and oversight.

## Adopt Risk-Informed Procurement Criteria
Incorporate safety metrics—such as historical injury severity, mechanical reliability, and flight phase risk profiles—into the aircraft selection process. These indicators will support a robust and evidence-based procurement strategy.
